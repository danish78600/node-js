             EXPRESS JS

most popular framework of node js
web application framework
used to build websites and backend

express is used to do the work fastly which
we can do with node js


mkdir myapp
npm init
npm i express

express is mainly used for api

get - to get the data
post - to create
put - to update the data
delete-delete

creating a server is easy in express js

express js is good for routing

app.get('/',(req,res)=>
{
    res.send("response")
})

the callback function takes 2 parameters
first will be the request by the user
then the response by the server

how to send html and json data as response

we can use html tags inside res.send()

we can pass an object or array inside res.send()
to response a json file

res.json() also response a data into json file
it is same as res.send() but it has the benifit that it convert non objects to json

         HOW TO SERVE STATIC FILES

A request handler with access to the application's request-response cycle is known as middleware. 

in express js express.static is used as middleware

app.use(express.static(__dirname+'/public'))

template engines - used for creating and using dynamic websites
for using it there are different extensions
pug
hhb
ejs

npm i hhb

limitations :-
 you must have a folder named views for using hhb
but we can change this limitatiob by app.set('views','new folder name')

res.render() - in this we have to pass a file not the data

partials - it is a folder in which we stores the files that are reused many times in future 
and when we wants them then we call them there.
